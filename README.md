# Philippine Holiday Optimizer 🇵🇭

A web application designed to help users in the Philippines strategically plan their leave days and work-from-home (WFH) schedule around public holidays to maximize consecutive time off. It visualizes holidays for a selected month and year (currently focused on 2026 data) and provides an optimized schedule based on user preferences.

## Features

*   **Monthly Calendar View:** Displays a calendar for the selected month and year.
*   **Holiday Highlighting:** Clearly marks Regular Holidays (paid) and Special Non-working Holidays.
*   **Optimized Schedule Visualization:** Shows recommended Leave days and Work-From-Home (WFH) days directly on the calendar.
*   **User Configuration:**
    *   Set the maximum number of WFH days allowed per week.
    *   Input the total number of available leave credits.
    *   Select the target month and year (currently defaults and data focus on 2026).
*   **Optimization Results:**
    *   Calculates the maximum number of consecutive days off achievable with the plan.
    *   Shows the total number of days off (weekends + holidays + leave + WFH).
    *   Lists the specific dates recommended for Leave and WFH.
*   **Informative Legend:** Explains the color-coding and badges used in the calendar.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes.

## How it Works

The optimizer uses a scoring system based on the 2026 Philippine holiday list:

1.  **Holiday Data:** Uses a predefined list of 2026 Regular and Special Non-working holidays.
2.  **Leave Day Scoring:** Potential workdays are scored based on their potential to create long weekends or bridge gaps:
    *   Days adjacent (immediately before/after) to weekends or holidays get higher scores.
    *   "Bridge days" (workdays falling between two off-days like a weekend and a holiday) receive the highest scores.
    *   Mondays and Fridays generally get a boost for extending weekends.
3.  **Leave Allocation:** The highest-scoring workdays are recommended as leave days, up to the user's specified limit.
4.  **WFH Allocation:** Remaining workdays are considered for WFH. The optimizer prioritizes days that are strategically beneficial (e.g., adjacent to off days) and distributes them across the weeks, respecting the user's maximum WFH days per week limit.
5.  **Metrics Calculation:** Calculates the longest consecutive block of off-days (weekends, holidays, leave, WFH) and the total number of off-days in the month based on the generated plan.

*Note: The current holiday data and optimization logic are based on the year 2026.*
